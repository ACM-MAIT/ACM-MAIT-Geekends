Rahul has just learned about bits in computer science class. To test his understanding the teacher gives him a simple exercise to input two numbes in binary and find the common digits in them. But Rahul found the problem too easy so he decided to solve this own problem of finding the position of rightmost common digit in the binary numbers.

### **Input Format**
The first line contains a single integer t, denoting number of test cases.
Next line contains two numbers whose common bit has to be found out.

### **Constraints**

* 1<= t <= 10^5
* 1<= a,b <= 10^5

### **Sample Input**
1 <br>
5 7 <br>

### **Sample Output**
1 <br>
