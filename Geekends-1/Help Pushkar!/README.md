Pushkar has a hectic day ahead of him.He has several power bars which will provide him the required energy (in calories) to be active throughout the day.However he can only consume in total exactly W grams at a time..Help him to find a combination of power bars that provides him the maximum energy assuming that he can eat any fraction of a power bar.

### **Input Format** 
The first line of the input contains the number n of power bars and the amount W (in grams) Pushkar can consume at a time. 
The next n lines define the calories and weights of the power bars.
The i-th line contains integers vi and wi —the calories and the weight of i-th power bar, respectively.

### **Constraints**

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^(3)
* 0 ≤ W ≤ 2·10^(6)
* 0 ≤ vi ≤ 2·10^(6)
* 0 < wi ≤ 2·10^(6) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
* All the numbers are integers.

### **Output Format** 
Output the maximal calories of fractions of power bars that Pushkar eats. The absolute value of the difference between the answer of your program and the optimal value should be at most 10^(-3). To ensure this, output your answer with at least four digits after the decimal point (otherwise your answer, while being computed correctly, can turn out to be wrong because of rounding issues). <br>

### **Sample Input**
3 50 <br>
60 20 <br>
100 50 <br>
120 30 <br>

### **Sample Output**
180.0000 <br>
